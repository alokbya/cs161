OBJECTIVES
1.  List all even numbers from 4 to 1,000 along with two primes which add to the same number
2.  Be sure to program the case where you find an even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes
3.  You can test this code by seeing if all integers between 4 and 1000 can be expressed as a sum of 2 primes

LAYOUT
1.  Make an isPrime() function to return true if argument is prime, false if not
2.  Make a function to list out all even numbers between 4 and 1000:wq
